## Git command
- git init : create a local repository
- git clone \<url\> : clone from an url (https or SSH)
- git add \<file\> : add a file for the next commit
- git commit -m "\<message\>" : do a commit with a message (the commit is still in local)
- git pull : pull the changes made from the remote to the local
- git push : push the local commit onto the remote
- git checkout \<branch\>: get info on the branch
- git status : see the status of the current branch

## Conflict from feature2
Benjamin doesn't like conflicts :(
But some of them are unavoidable and we have to manage them.
